  <h2>Small Lagon(El Nido)</h2>
  <p>
  The Small Lagoon is accessible through a gap between two giant limestone rocks that appear to be about to kiss each other. Through this little space, one can swim or kayak into the lagoon. It is actually these cliffs, and the rocks and corals in the shallow part of the area that temper the waves, protecting the water in the lagoon from the all whatever violent events in the open sea.

  <h2>Big Lagon(El Nido)</h2>
  <p>
  The Big Lagoon is one of the more popular snorkeling spots in El Nido. It has deep emerald waters and is frequented by sea turtles. It is a bay carved into the island, with dazzlingly clear water and corals below; pointed limestone cliffs tower above you as you drift into the lagoon. Water and coral conditions made this lagoon relatively free of marine life, but kayakers will find this a magnificent backdrop to paddle through.

  <h2>Secret Lagon(El Nido)</h2>
  <p>
  Secret Lagoon, also known as Hidden Lagoon, of Miniloc Island. All along, we thought the Secret Lagoon was the beach behind the giant rocks to our right. Apparently, thereâ€™s another world behind the karst rocks on the other side, so hidden that I had to twist my body like a pretzel to get there.
